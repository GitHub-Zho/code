hello teacher,

my java program is in the "with GUI" file
because the program needs to read a wordlist file
so it have to running in the "with GUI" path to read from the same path
----------------------------------------------------------------------
and you can start the game by click start button
and then you can --- press the "Enter" button on you keybord --- to submit your guess
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I want it to be like the game mechine we have played before,
so i have try my best to make it's picture and the structure more like the game mechine.

(like the storage, the outermost layer itself like the game mechine which only stores the rank of player,
and after the mechina is power off, the storage will be clean. 
And when you go back to the outermost layer from the game and try to start a new game,
it will consider you a new player, and etc.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The one "without GUI" file is the program which can not played in cmd 
because there is an usage of "Escape characters" (i dont know whether it has been translated right)
in the "print" function can be only used in IDEs like vscode or idea

but i really like the rustic and minimalist style from the terminal 
so although i do not complete it so well 
but i still want to submit it and hope you would like it       : ï¼‰
